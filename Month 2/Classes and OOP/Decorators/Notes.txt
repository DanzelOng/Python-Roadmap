# Decorators
- Allow us to extend functionality of a function without modifying it
- We decorate a function by using the decorator synthax @<decorator-function>


# Key Concepts
1. Decorater function - outer function

2. Function doing the decoration - inner function

3. Decorated function - function being passed into the outer function

4. The return from the outer function is the inner function 


# Chaining of decorators
- functions can be chained with decorators
- the order whereby a function is decorated first depends upon how they are listed, from top to bottom
  the function will be decorated with the bottom most decorator first
