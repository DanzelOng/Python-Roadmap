# What is Inheritance?
- Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes
  and methods from other classes
- Reduces repeated code
- Helps promote code reusability and a clean organized codebase


# Subclass and superclass 
- A class which inherits from another class is a subclass, 
  and the class which is inherited from is the superclass


# Types of Inheritance
1. Single Inheritance
- Most common type of inheritance, occurs when a class inherits from a 
  parent class


2. Multiple Inheritance
- Occurs when a class inherits from 2 or more superclasses
- These superclasses may or may not be logically related to one another


3. Multi-Level Inheritance
- Occurs when a class inherits from a class that inherits from another class


# Method Resolution Order (MRO)
- MRO is the order where a method is searched for in a class hierarchy
- If 2 or more classes contain the same method, 
  Python will choose the class one hierarchy above the subclass
- If a method is not found anywhere but in the base class,
  and the method is called from the deepest subclass,
  Python will search for it through the MRO
